Java Calculator

A  Java calculator created to practice core Java concepts such as primitive data types, user input, arithmetic operations, type casting, and variable scope.

Overview

This project demonstrates:

Usage of all Java primitive data types

Taking user input using the Scanner class

Performing basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)

Handling invalid input (for example, division by zero)

Type casting (widening and narrowing)

Formatted output using System.out.printf()

Difference between local, instance, and static variables

Technologies Used

Java

Console (Command Line Interface)

How to Run
javac Main.java

java Main

Learning Objective

The purpose of this project is to strengthen understanding of Java fundamentals and to practice writing clean, readable, and beginner-friendly code.

Conclusion

This project provides hands-on experience with basic Java programming concepts by implementing a calculator.
It helped in understanding how different data types work, how user input is handled, and how core logic is implemented in a structured way.
This project builds a solid foundation for learning more advanced Java topics in the future.
